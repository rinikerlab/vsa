VCD Spectra Alignment (VSA)

Lennard BÃ¶selt

Alpha version (v0.6)

The idea behind this approach is two fold:
1. Automatically identify the individual scaling factors of each normal mode. 
2. Determine the absolute stereochemistry of the given molecule.

If users of this code find any bugs, or have molecules where this given approach does not work, please share it with us.
