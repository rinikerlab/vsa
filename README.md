VCD Spectra Alignment (VSA)

Lennard Boeselt

Alpha version (v0.6)

The idea behind this project is two-folded:
1. Automatically identify the individual scaling factors of each normal-mode. 
2. Determine the absolute stereochemistry of the given molecule.
If users of this code find any bugs, or have molecules where this given approach does not work, we would be very pleased if this could be shared with us.

TO BE ADDED:
1. INSTALLATION GUIDE
2. EXAMPLE FILES
3. GUI
4. SI/SSO for comparison
5. ANALYSIS SCRIPTS USED IN THE ORIGINAL PUBLICATION
6. SCRIPTS TO CREATE THE CONFORMATIONAL ENSEMBLE
7. INTERFACES TO TURBOMOLE, GAUSSIAN16, DALTON
